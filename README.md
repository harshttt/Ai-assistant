# Virtual AI Assistant

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Virtual AI Assistant** is a web-based application that responds to voice commands, processes speech input, and performs tasks like opening websites, telling the time/date, and providing personalized greetings. Built using JavaScript and modern web APIs, this assistant simulates an AI-powered interaction with users through a sleek and stylish interface.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Voice Recognition**: Uses the Web Speech API to capture and interpret user voice commands.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Provides audio feedback using the SpeechSynthesis API.
- **Task Execution**: Supports commands like:
  - Opening popular websites (Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
  - Announcing the current time and date
  - Personalized greetings based on time of day
- **Dynamic UI**: Modern, responsive design with animated buttons and custom fonts.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
- **HTML** — Structuring the web page
- **CSS** — Styling with custom animations and gradients
- **JavaScript** — Core logic for voice commands, speech output, and dynamic content
- **Web Speech API** — SpeechRecognition and SpeechSynthesis for voice interactions
- **Google Fonts** — Custom typography with "Protest Guerrilla"
